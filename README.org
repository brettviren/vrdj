#+title Virtual Radio DJ

The vrdj (poorly) tries to do what real human DJs do: find songs that go well
together.  It does this by identifying a set of songs that are similar to a seed
song or a set of seed songs.  Similarity is based on applying the VGGish
embedding model to form vectors and then finding vectors for other songs that are need the vector(s) for the seed(s).

The vrdj works best when used as a beets plugin.
