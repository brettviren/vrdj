#+title Virtual Radio DJ

* Goals

The vrdj package provides:

- a set of Python modules
- command line program
- beets plugin

in order to generate associations between sets of songs in a collection.  For
example, given a song, vrdj can list the ten most similar songs in the
collection.  Or, the ten least similar songs.  Different comparison methods are
supported.

* Architecture

Comparisons are based on digests of song audio data.  Initially, VGGish
embeddings are constructed and from these FAISS vectors are produced that span
time segments of songs.  Per-segment vectors and a per-song and per-album
average vectors are stored in corresponding FAISS indices.  Associations between
Beets and FAISS are stored in a vrdj sqlite3 database as are the embedding values.
